Hello!

This is the initial README file for GROUP Y in the COMP 3120 Group Project. This README needs to include:

- An outline of the application you were aiming to build, target users, data sources etc (similar to the proposal).
- A reference to your second Github repository if you used one.
- A description of what you have been able to implement in this MVP, use your milestones to highlight what you've achieved.
- A guide to the project source code - where should we look for what you have done.
- A summary of what your next steps would be if you were to continue the project.
- A summary of the main roles and contributions of each team member and how you managed interaction and communication through the project.
