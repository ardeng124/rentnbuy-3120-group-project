Hello!

This is the initial README file for GROUP Y in the COMP 3120 Group Project. This README needs to include:

## Application
- Name: Rent N Buy
- URL: RnB.com.au or rentnbuy.com.au
- Slogan: “A platform to list, rent, buy and critique anything”
- Purpose: This application will be designed by Group Y  to provide:
    - A platform Rent/Buying application that allows for users to rent and sell items on the site
    - Allow users to give reviews of different services and items
    - Showcasing of associated photos and description of each product

## Target Audience/Users
- Potential buyers of a product looking to find what other people think
- Must be 12+ to create an account. The application will filter certain features/pages depending on the users age:
    - Examples will be that it will filter movies and games of a certain rating
    - Profanity filtering for users under the age of 18

## Data Sources
Group Y will make use of MongoDB as its dedicated backend database, which will be used to store the following potential information:

### Mongo Database (MongoDB)
|---------|--------|
| Session | UserID |
|         | Token  |
|---------|--------|



### Local Storage (Cookies)
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cookies: | - "Cart details (Object containing an array of items, the total cost)" |
|          | - "SessionID / JWT / method of identifying user"                       |
